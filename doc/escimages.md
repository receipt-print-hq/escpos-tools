# escimages

`escimages` extracts raster images from binary ESC/POS files.

All non-graphical elements of the receipt are ignored, and a pair of files is
written (in PBM and PNG format) for each image found in the source file.

## Installation

This utility is included with escpos-tools. See the
[escpos-tools documentation](https://github.com/receipt-print-hq/escpos-tools)
for installation instructions.

## Usage

```
Usage: escimages.php OPTIONS --file 'filename'

 Required options:

  -f, --file FILE             The input file to read.

 Output options:

  -o, --output-dir DIRECTORY  The directory to write output files to.

 Output format:

  Select one or more formats for output. If none is specified, then PNG is used.

  --png                        Write output files in PNG format.
  --pbm                        Write output files in PBM format.

 Other options:
  -h, --help                   Show this help

```

## Example

```
$ php escimages.php -f receipt-with-logo.bin
```

The raster image from the input receipt is extracted in PNG format:

![receipt-with-logo-img.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/receipt-print-hq/escpos-tools/master/doc/receipt-with-logo-img.png)

The same binary data, when sent to a printer, renders as below:

```
$ cat receipt-with-logo.bin > /dev/usb/lp0
```

![receipt-with-logo-small.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/receipt-print-hq/escpos-tools/master/doc/receipt-with-logo-small.png)

The input file used as an example here was generated by [escpos-php](https://github.com/mike42/escpos-php), and is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/receipt-print-hq/escpos-tools/master/receipt-with-logo.bin).

## Further conversions

This utility will create raster images only. They can be printed back to a printer
via `escpos-php`, or rendered to other formats with the ImageMagick `convert` utility.

In some cases, drivers convert text to a series of images before printing. To recover
text from this type of receipt, the images from `escimage` can be stacked and
sent through a suitable OCR tool.

For example, using `tesseract`:

```
rm *.pbm
php escimages.php -f input.bin --pbm
convert -append *.pbm pbm:- | tesseract - -
```
