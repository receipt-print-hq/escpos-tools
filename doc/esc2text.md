# esc2text

`esc2text` extracts text from binary ESC/POS files.

Default encoding is [CP437](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437) If your ESC/POS binary file different encoding, set **SOURCE_ENCODING** environment variable.

The plaintext output is UTF-8 encoded, and written to standard output.

It operates by reading all of the commands in the input file, and discarding
those which do not contain text or line breaks. Add `-v` as the last argument
to see all the other commands for debugging purposes.

The input file used as an example here was generated by [escpos-php](https://github.com/mike42/escpos-php), and is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/receipt-print-hq/escpos-tools/master/receipt-with-logo.bin).

## Further conversions

This utility will create unformatted plaintext files. Other formats can be accessed
by performing a second conversion via the `unoconv` and `pandoc` utilites.

These can produce  DOC, HTML, PDF or RTF versions of the same output, among other formats.

In some cases, drivers convert text to a series of image before printing, so there is no
text the ESC/POS file. In this case, `esc2text` will correctly return a blank text file.
Images can be extracted with `escimage` and put through a suitable OCR tool.
