# esc2html

`esc2html` converts an ESC/POS binary file into a HTML document. It is currently capable of rendering some types of
formatting and images, plus any ASCII text in the input file.

```
$ php esc2html.php receipt-with-logo.bin > output.html
```

## Installation

This utility is included with escpos-tools. See the
[escpos-tools documentation](https://github.com/receipt-print-hq/escpos-tools) for installation instructions.

## Usage

```
php esc2html FILE
```

## Example

```
$ php esc2html.php receipt-with-logo.bin > receipt-with-logo.html
```

The HTML representation of the receipt is saved to a new file, and appears as:

![receipt-with-logo-img.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/receipt-print-hq/escpos-tools/master/doc/receipt-with-logo-html.png)

The same binary data, when sent to a printer, renders as below:

```
$ cat receipt-with-logo.bin > /dev/usb/lp0
```

![receipt-with-logo-small.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/receipt-print-hq/escpos-tools/master/doc/receipt-with-logo-small.png)

The input file used as an example here was generated by [escpos-php](https://github.com/mike42/escpos-php), and is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/receipt-print-hq/escpos-tools/master/receipt-with-logo.bin).

## Further conversions

This utility will create a formatted HTML file. This can be converted accurately to PDF
via `wkhtmltopdf`, where formatted plaintext can be subsequently extracted via
`pdftotext -f -nopagebrk`, or images can be extracted via `pdfimages`. If some text
is embedded in the finished document as an image, then `pdfsandwich` can apply optical
character recognition to this.

Alternatively, the HTML may be converted accurately to a raster image via `wkhtmltoimage`.

The correct layout of the HTML document partially depends on the use of CSS3, so the
use of document converters such as `unoconv` and `pandoc` tends to lose some information.

These can can be used to produce RTF, DOC, and some other formats if the lossy conversion
is acceptable.
